# Notes

### How to start playing with this

- Sign in as any user
- Place a bid
- Close the auction (dropdown menu) for an hour that falls within your bid range
- Observe how the order is filled (based on capacity, price, and competing bids)
- Notice changes in available capacity
- Sign in as another user and repeat (all users occupy the same "world" and compete for same GPUs)
- Feel free to try cancelling/creating bids, re-closing auctions (would never happen in real life but gives you a chance to experiment with the system)
- If anything is confusing or appears broken, let me know!

### How it works

- Abstract representations of GPUs are maintained; they can be allocated no more than once per hour
- Users can place bids for X GPUs, for Y amount of time, at Z price
- When the auction for a given hour closes, all GPUs (starting capacity of 100) are allocated in order of bid amount, until capacity is exhausted

### If this were a production codebase, I would

- Componentize more (for readability)
- Memoize/[callback](https://react.dev/reference/react/useCallback) more (for performance)
- Wrap things like auth, orders, etc. into [contexts](https://react.dev/reference/react/createContext) (for maintainability)
- Add Postgres [RLS](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/ddl-rowsecurity.html) (for security)

### Stack

- Next.js front-end + serverless functions
- Supabase managed Postgres

### Available endpoints

- GET /api/capacity
- POST /api/close-auction
- POST /api/place-bid

### Implementation things

- A couple buttons are perma-disabled, I included them for design completeness
- Initially, I was going to use a cron job to automatically close auctions for each hour, on an hourly basis, as some form of this would exist in production. I realized this was annoying to test/review, so I made it accessible via UI instead (dropdown, top-right corner).
- All dates are in UTC unless stated otherwise
- I went with the GPU-hour level of resolution, rather than GPU-day (for liquidity purposes)

### Auction structure

- I've built a [discriminatory price](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiunit_auction), sealed bid auction system
- In production, I suspect an open-bid format (where bidders can see max bid) might be better

### Other ideas

#### Auction vs instant reservation

- I think it'd be crucial to have an "Instant Reservation" option, a la Ebay's "Buy it now." This would enable paying a premium for guaranteed, full-block reservations.
- I imagine "Instant Reservation" would be ideal for larger, inflexible buyers
- Bidding would be ideal for smaller, cost-sensitive, or otherwise flexible buyers
- The former group would presumably take the majority of capacity, with the remaining bits being auctioned off

#### Pricing system (for instant reservation)

- The pricing function should probably slope upwards gradually. I.e., cheaper reservations now (if available), and more expensive as reservation date is further in the future
- Rough example function: f(x) = 0.468ln(x+1) + .6
  - When x > 168 hours (1 week), f(x) = market_rate

#### Point system (for auction)

- A point system could offer a dial to tune incentives.
- The points associated with any given GPU-hour bid could be a function of both price and block size (of the whole bid).
  - Example function: f(s, p) = .3sqrt(s) + .7p
    - Where s is full block size, and p is price per GPU-hour
- This could incentivize larger block purchases, without letting whales dominate with massive, low-priced blocks (curtailed by the sqrt)

If there's anything I didn't include in the project/notes, there's a good chance I've thought about it - feel free to ask
